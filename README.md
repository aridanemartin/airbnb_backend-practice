Lemoncode - Backend Practice with PODS Architecture:

This repository hosts a practice project focusing on creating a RESTful API for a house booking portal. Key tasks include setting up a MongoDB Atlas database with Airbnb data and implementing essential features:

1. House Listings:

Users search for houses by country, retrieving a list from the backend.
2. House Details:

Users view specific house details: title, image, description, address, rooms, beds, baths, and the latest 5 reviews.
Project Objectives:

Configure libraries (Express, TypeScript) progressively.
Structure the backend using pods architecture.
Implement endpoints for house listing, house details, and adding reviews.
Use mock data initially and later integrate MongoDB.
Add unit tests for mappers and helpers.
Implement pagination for house listing.
Optional Tasks:

Implement endpoints with Mongoose (feature/mongoose branch).
Add login and update house detail endpoints.
Secure update endpoint for admin access.
Include integration tests.
Create a console runner for database tasks.
This concise guide provides a robust foundation for building a RESTful API, covering both essential and advanced functionalities for a house booking platform.
